# Lab 1 - Setup Istio

Now that we have a Kubernetes cluster and Meshery, we are ready to download and deploy Istio resources.

## Steps

* [1. Install Istio](#1)
* [2. Verify install](#2)
* [3. Confirm add-ons](#3)

Optional (manual install of Istio):
* [1. Download Istio resources](#1.1)
* [2. Setup `istioctl`](#1.2)

## <a name="1"></a> 1 - Install Istio

In Meshery, select the deployed Istio adapter in the left nav menu under the `Management` section ([see screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leecalcote/istio-service-mesh-workshop/feature/blend-in-meshery/lab-1/img/meshery_management_istio.png)).

On the Istio adapter's management page, on the `Manage Service Mesh Lifecycle` card, you can click on the (+) icon and select `Latest Istio with mTLS` to install the latest version of Istio with mTLS ([see screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leecalcote/istio-service-mesh-workshop/feature/blend-in-meshery/lab-1/img/meshery_management_istio-install.png)).

## <a name="2"></a> 2 - Verify install

On the Istio adapter's management page, on the `Validate Service Mesh Configuration` card, you can click on the (+) icon and select `Verify Installation` to verify the Istio installation inside the cluster.

#### Alternatively:

Istio is deployed in a separate Kubernetes namespace `istio-system`. To check if Istio is deployed, and also, to see all the pieces that are deployed, execute the following:

```sh
kubectl get all -n istio-system
```

## <a name="3"></a> 3 - Install Add-ons
	
Istio, as part of this workshop, is installed with several optional addons like:
1. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
2. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
3. [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
4. [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
5. [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io/)
	
You will use Prometheus and Grafana for collecting and viewing metrics, while for viewing distributed traces, you can choose between [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) or [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). In this training, we will use Jaeger.
	
Kiali is another add-on which can be used to generate a graph of services within an Istio mesh and is deployed as part of Istio in this lab.

Alternative, manual installation steps below. No need to execute, if you have performed the steps above.

## <a name="appendix"></a> Appendix - Alternative Manual Install

### <a name="1.1"></a> 1.1 - Download Istio
You will download and deploy the latest Istio resources on your Kubernetes cluster. 

***Note to Docker Desktop users:*** please ensure your Docker VM has atleast 4GiB of Memory, which is required for all services to run.

On your local machine:
```sh
curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.7.3 sh -
```

### <a name="1.2"></a> 1.2 - Setting up istioctl
On a *nix system, you can setup istioctl by doing the following: 

The above command will get the latest Istio package and untar it in the same folder.

Change into the Istio package directory and add the `istioctl` client to your PATH environment variable.
```sh
cd istio-*
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

To verify `istioctl` is setup lets try to print out the command help
```sh
istioctl version
```

We can use a new feature in istioctl to check if the cluster is ready for install:

```sh
istioctl verify-install
```

### Install istio:

To install istio with a `demo` profile, execute the below command.
```sh
istioctl install --set profile=demo
```
